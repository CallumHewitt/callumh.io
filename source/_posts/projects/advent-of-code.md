Advent of Code is an annual programming puzzle event that runs from the 1st of December until Christmas. I've participated in the event for a number of years. It's a great event and has been really helpful in improving both my Python and JavaScript.

You can find my Advent of Code solutions on my GitHub [here](https://github.com/CallumHewitt/adventofcode).
