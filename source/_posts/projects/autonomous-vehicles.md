In a world with fully autonomous vehicles, we will need to develop strategies for managing complex traffic scenarios. In my final year at university, I worked on a project to augment a simulator designed by researchers from The University of Texas, and compare different lane merging strategies for fully autonomous vehicles.

You can get the full report on my GitHub [here](https://github.com/CallumHewitt/avLaneMergingReport). You can also experiment with the simulator itself [here](https://github.com/CallumHewitt/AVSimulatorProject).
