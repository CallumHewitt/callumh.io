Hello, my name is Callum Hewitt and I'm a senior software engineer based in London.

I'm currently working in financial services on large-scale, event-driven systems. I'm primarily a Java engineer, but I've also written production code using Python and JavaScript. I love experimenting with new technology, and I have a particular passion for DevOps, software architecture and improving team workflows.

This website is designed to be a hub for my personal projects. It's a way for me to experiment with different technologies, and share the results in one place. You can find all of my projects [here](/projects/).

If you're interested in reaching out to me personally, please send me a message on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/callumhewittdev/).
